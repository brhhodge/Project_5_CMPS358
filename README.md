# Project_5_CMPS3458
Project Description Create a computing system that can be operated as above. The system will consists of a server running in a console application that will wait for a client (also running as a console application) to connect and, when it connects, will allow messages to be exchanged. The exchange will be in “lock step” with the client sending its user’s message first, the server then displaying the received message. The server’s user can then transmit a message to the client, which the client will then display. At this point, the client’s user can transmit another message, etc.
